This repository consists to code that I used while learning from the book 'Introduction to reinforcement learning' by Barto and Sutton
I have written code for replicating Fig2.2 in Chapter 2 of the book- comparison of epsilon-greedy methods and greedy-method. THe code can be found in Replicating_fig2_2_chap_2.py and the result obtained in Replicated_fig_2.2.png. The array below the result is the reward used for the runs.
